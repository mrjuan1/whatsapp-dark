# WhatsApp Dark Mode Chrome/Chromium Extension

A simple Chrome/Chromium extension that appends a "dark" class name to the body tag on [web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com/).

## Usage

Clone this repo and move it to a location that's out of your way.

Open Chrome/Chromium and browse to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions). Enable "Developer mode" at the top-right of the screen and click on the "Load unpacked" button near the top-left.

Browse to where you moved the cloned repository and select that directory.

And that's it, browsing to [web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com/) should now display in dark mode properly.
